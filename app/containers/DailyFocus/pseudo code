on double click find item by id,
edit function, takes id creates an input box
the value of said box is the todo.text
allow user to edit and then on submit, change
todo.text visually and in the database

use form so input can be submitted with enter or button


find index

change editing state to true, which changes button display

can either do double click and form submit as a way to save changes or change the edit state with a button click and then change it again with another button click

add counting functionality?

on double click, a text input box appears, with the value as todo.text. when you submit the form (by button or enter key), the todo.text changes (in the display and in the database)
  styling wise, the color of the text changes to let you know that you are in editing mode and a save button appears
